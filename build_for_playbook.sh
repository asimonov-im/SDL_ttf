# This script builds the SDL library.  It is useful as 
# an example of how to build software for the playbook 
# platform where the build system for that software is 
# configured with autoconf tools. 


#We set a destination where everything gets installed.

# Note that we explicitly put --without-x because the configure 
# system has been known to forget that we are cross compiling
